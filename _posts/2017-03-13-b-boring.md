Some time ago, I gave a talk about 
[boring technology at Booking](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/isotopp/boring-dot-com-the-virtues-of-boring-technology),
which means choosing the simplest, stable and maintainable solution you can
get away with for solving a problem at a given scale. 

Apparently Dan McKinley has similar views, which he explained in 
[Choose Boring Technology](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology). The
writeup explains nicely what boring technology is, and why to prefer this.
Never forget your mission, which is business, not technology. The technology
is a necessary tool, but likely 
[not your friend](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/isotopp/be-simple-be-boring-be-obvious).
