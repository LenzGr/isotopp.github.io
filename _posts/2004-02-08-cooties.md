In order to understand SCOs theories, one must first understand the theory
of cooties. Cooties are invisible ickies that can be transmitted, usually by
touch, but often by mere association.

Under the Cootie theory of copyright and trade secret law, Linux looks like
Unix, so now Linux has cooties. IBM touched Unix, thus giving cooties to
AIX. JFS acquired cooties when it was ported to AIX, even though JFS didn't
have cooties when it was originally developed. Thus, Linux has cooties
because it has AIX's cooties which AIX got from staring cross-eyed at Unix.
Linux has the same header lines as Unix, therefore Linux has Unix cooties.
In conclusion, anyone touching Linux will get cooties and owe a cootie tax
to SCO, which will soon have more money than Scrooge McDuck.

property law I learned on the elementary school playground.", by Darl
McBride.
