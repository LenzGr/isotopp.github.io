[Inside Science reports](https://www.insidescience.org/news/driving-fee-rolls-back-asthma-attacks-stockholm)
on the congestion charge in Stockholm 
([Link to actual paper](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2017/preliminary/1901)). 
Stockholm always has been a city with relatively clean air and PM10 and NOx
levels well below limits. The introduction of a congestion charge in 2007
reduced air pollution in Stockholm by approximately 10 percent. Yet, after
several years, Asthma in children 0-5 years old is reduced of 45 percent.

> "It appears that what they've found is these cumulative effects of
> pollution," he said.

The article also reminds city policy makers that a congestion charge can
only work if a viable public transport infrastructure is already in place.
