Here is a [user story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) for
implementors of security systems and platform hardening initiatives:

> As **any user** , I never want to get a "denied" message, but a " **in
> order to do what you want you are missing the _X_ permission**" message in
> order to be able to track down the root cause and request the appropriate
> permissions more easily.

It's not that hard, really. 

> GitLab: You are not allowed to push code to this project.

Well, it's harder for some, apparently. That's one hour of my life I am not
getting back.
