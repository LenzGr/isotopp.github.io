Short link to [NBC Miami](http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/South-Miami-Set-to-Become-First-City-in-Florida-to-Require-Solar-Panels-on-New-Homes-434557443.html):

> South Miami Set to Become First City in Florida to Require Solar Panels on
> New Homes The new law would require owners of new homes -- including
> single-family homes, townhouses and multi-story residential buildings --
> to install solar panels. It also applies to owners who expand their homes
> by 75% or greater. Once the measure is passed, South Miami would become
> the fourth U.S. city that requires new homes to be installed with solar
> panels. San Francisco and two small cities in California have similar
> renewable energy building laws.
