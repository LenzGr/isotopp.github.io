There is a well known Github Gist 
"[Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know](https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832)", 
which explains which things take how long.

[Scaled Latency Numbers](https://twitter.com/srigi/status/917998817051541504)

If you scale these things down 3 billion times, a clock cycle (0.3ns)
becomes a second. And suddenly things are relateable.
